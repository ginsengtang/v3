Take an integer or a decimal.

The digital root is the sum of all of the digits mod 9.

For example, the digital root of

digitalRoot(293) = digitalRoot(14) = 5


Suppose
        a * b = c

digitalRoot(digitalRoot (a) * digitalRoot(b)) = digitalRoot (c)



Math is important.



A feasible goal for me is to create a database and a
web query engine to get options quotes and store them into
a database for analytical purposes.

So much data is not saved and is lost forever.


Breathing, memory, and math, these are things I
want to get better at.
