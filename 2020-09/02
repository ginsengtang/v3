Two people have to agree that something is love
for it to be love.


It's hard for two people to agree on anything.


It's hard for emotions to agree with logic.




Perhaps, love is in existing.
You are loved and you exist.

It's something
to be experienced,
never understood.




When I talked or wrote, I was
lying unintentionally. I was coming up with excuses
instead of getting things done. I was slow to move
and slow to act.

I should not post an expectation of where I want to be or
where I expect to be tomorrow or a week from now.

I should not be allowed to talk about my day
or my feelings.

I should only allow myself to say where I am so that it's clear
that I'm not misleading anyone.


Today, I am in Dallas.
