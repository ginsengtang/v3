I feel I have trouble breathing, nothing
serious. Just a lot of sighing, feeling
every time I take a breath, I feel sadness and
melancholy.




I do not know if it is because I did not write.

I do not know if it's because I anticipate writing.

I do not know if it's because I was writing through the
github interface on my ipad, instead of typing
on a console.


                      write               didn't write


trouble breathing 


no
trouble breathing




There is some emotional matrix or logic puzzle that I can try
and figure out.

I can perform different behaviors
so that I don't feel negative for long periods of time.

I may have trouble breathing regardless of whether
or not I write.






I like spending time with all of my siblings. We haven't spent
time playing board games altogether in a long time.

My brother returned to Dallas from Houston 3 weeks ago.
This week was the first time I saw him in half a year.

I feel that our relationship is strained, because
we fought a lot ideologically, physically, mentally.

He is working for two-sigma in Houston. He had the opportunity
to work in New York. He chose to work in Houston.

hmm...
when writing about kin,
I don't feel very negative,
short of breath, anxious.


kin  =>  kind

kindness is derived from kin.
