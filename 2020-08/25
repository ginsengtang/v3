There is no more meaning to be had.

If the feeling of safety has disappeared,
then I cannot be around you.

If I am associated with threatening
behavior, then there is no point in me
trying to manufacture a meeting.


If I make you afraid, then there is
no point in being together. You cannot
trust me, and when people do
not trust one another, both individuals
are vulnerable to disaster.




There is no meeting between you and I that takes place
that is not manufactured.

Every meeting that takes place between you and I 
is manufactured and can only make one another more
suspicious of the other.

This is the problem with me choosing to know
and choosing to say things out of context and choosing
to know things that are dangerous for me to know.



For the safety and comfort and risk tolerance and sanity of
both you and I.
I will stop trying to find that chance meeting.

Instead, I will live and move on.
