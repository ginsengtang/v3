I have nothing materially important to say.

I have made the mistake of projecting
that I will have nothing material to say
for the rest of my life.

It's very easy to fall into a trap of
extrapolation.

In any case, I am pretty confident in my
ability to make and keep a commitment.

I will not hold myself to a writing
commitment anymore.

I need to study more.
