I am in Dallas.

Every time I write or talk,
I don't feel very good about myself.

There are things I need to get done.

What are my priorities?

It depends on the time. 5 years ago,
what are my priorities?

What does it mean to prioritize family
or a spouse?

Whenever you exist
together in the same place, you are there.
You are present.


Whenever you are apart, you need to take
care of whatever you need to take care of,
so that it doesn't take away from you
being present.


I'm not sure this is correct.

I'm not a good example of this either.
