I took a walk, I took some pictures, and I posted
them on Line.


I'm kind of tired, I'm going to prepare for bed.

At 8:30PM, I walked from the south side of the river
into the city down 3rd street, past a dance building, 
past an orange theory fitness, past an open parking
lot, I think I turned right at a place called
Tito's.



Tito's is memorable because of some stupid sign
that they had.

We are apart, and we are in this together.



I walked across the lavaca bridge and went
to eat dinner.

Perhaps, I should wake up earlier and hit the gym
first thing in the morning.

But this is too much information, and it may be
difficult to process.

Maybe I should just try to settle into a routine
first.
